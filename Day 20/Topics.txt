Build the Snake Game with Turtle Graphics and OOP

Breakdown of Steps

1. Create the snake body:
   - Initial snake body comprises 3 squares.
   
2. Move the snake
   Strategy: Make the snake segments move to the position of the segment in front, starting from the last segment. 
   Then move the first segment forward.
   - Use tracer(), update(), timer.sleep() to refresh turtle animation.

3. Control the snake
   - Snake should keep moving forward until any of the arrow keys - Up, Down, Left, Right - is pressed.
   - Snake cannot reverse on itself.
   - Use listen() and onkey() to listen for events and bind keys to certain methods. 

4. Detect collision with food
   - Food is blue circle on screen.
   - Snake collides with food within tolerance.
   - Food moves to random location.
   
5. Create a scoreboard and update scores
   - Scoreboard is a turtle, hence inherits from Turtle class.
   - Use turtle.write() to write text on the screen.
   
6. Detect collision with wall
   - Trigger the game over sequence when snake head is within the wall boundary.
   - Wall boundery is chosen based on iterative testing.
   
7. Detect collision with tail
   - Increase snake size when snake eats food.
   - Trigger game over sequence when snake head collides with (is within a few pixels) any of the other snake segments.
   
8. Customize the snake game.


Classes to build for the game
1. Snake
2. Food
3. Scoreboard


- List and tuple slicing
