Build the Snake Game with Turtle Graphics and OOP

Breakdown of Steps

1. Create the snake body:
   - Initial snake body comprises 3 squares.
   
2. Move the snake
   Strategy: Make the snake segments move to the position of the segment in front, starting from the last segment. 
   Then move the first segment forward.
   - Use tracer(), update(), timer.sleep() to refresh turtle animation.

3. Control the snake
   - Snake should keep moving forward until any of the arrow keys - Up, Down, Left, Right - is pressed.
   - Snake cannot reverse on itself.
   - Use listen() and onkey() to listen for events and bind keys to certain methods. 

4. Detect collision with food
5. Create a scoreboard and update scores
6. Detect collision with wall
7. Detect collision with tail
