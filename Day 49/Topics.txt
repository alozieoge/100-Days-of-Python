Project: Build an Automated Job Application Bot with Selenium

Objective: Apply for jobs on LinkedIn the 'coder' way.

Steps:

- Automatically log in:
  1. Go to the Jobs tab and search for the job that you are interested in e.g. "Python developer". 
     Add the "Easy Apply" filter and specify your desired location
  2. Copy the URL at the top of the address bar, it should contain all your requirements.
  3. Using the URL in Selenium webcriver, try to open the page by using the webdriver.
  4. Automatically log in to LinkedIn using Selenium. 
     Use time.sleep() to wait for page loads.
     
- Apply for a job:
  5. Use Selenium to automatically apply to the first job that only requires you to enter your phone number.
  
- Apply for all the jobs:
  6. Apply to the standard, 1-step applications.
     - Ignore the applications that require a note.
     - Ignore the complex, multi-step applications.
  7. Using what you've learnt (and some creativity/Googling) figure out how to get your Selenium bot to apply to all the jobs on the page. 
     Clicking on each job on the left hand side in-turn and applying to each one automatically.
     
Selenium has a custom exception that gets raised when an element cannot be found it's called NoSuchElementException.
- from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException
