Debugging

Tips:
1. Describe the problem: To understand what the issue is and test your assumptions to see what is false.

2. Reproduce the bug: Modify the code to reproduce the bug everytime the code is run.

3. Play computer: Step through each line of code, chceck the logic and see what it evaluates to.

4. Fix the error: When the editor/console is hinting at an error, fix it immediately. From the console, copy the last line(s) of the error and search for a solution in Google.
Somebugs don't return an error message. You have to build your problem-solving skills to be able to breakdown a problem and fix it.
Build experience by solving other people's bugs.

5. Print() is your friend: Print variables at intermediate steps.

6. Use a debugger: Python Tutor, Thorny, any Python IDE ... Use a break-point to pause code execution and examine the variable values.

7. Take a break: Change your immediate environment - Grab a coffee, take a walk, Go to sleep.

8. Ask a friend: They can see the problem with different perspective and they won't have the same assumptions you made.

9. Run your code often: Don't wait until the end to run your code, but test each added feature.

10. Ask StackOverflow: Search other people's questions and solutions. Last resort to ask for help.
