Capstone Project: BUild a Cheap Flight Tracker

API:
1. Sheety - Google Sheet Data Management API
2. Kiwi Tequila - Flight Search API
3. Twilio - SMS API

Project Requirements:
1. Make a copy of the 'Flight Deals' Google sheet.

2. Populate the 'IATA Code' column in the Google sheet with the IATA airport/station code for each city.
   - Flight Search + Sheety API
   a. Use the Sheety API HTTP GET request to return all the row data in the Google sheet.
   b. Pass everything stored in the "prices" key back to the main.py file and store it in a variable called sheet_data.
   c. If the "iata Code" column of sheet_data is empty, pass each city name in sheet_data one-by-one to the FlightSearch class to get the corresponding IATA code for that city using the Flight Search API.
   d. In the DataManager Class, make a HTTP PUT request and use the row id from sheet_data to update the Google Sheet with the IATA codes.
   
3. Check for the cheapest flight from tomorrow to 6 months later for the cities in Google sheet.
   - Flight Search.
   a. Search for the flight prices from London (LON) to all the destinations in the Google Sheet.
   b. Look only for: 
      - direct flights 
      - leaving anytime between tomorrow ... (use strftime() to format the date to the required format by the Flight Search API) 
      - and in 6 months (6x30days) time (use timedelta() from the datatime module to define a 6-month period)
      - round trips 
      - return between 7 and 28 days in length 
      - currency of the price in GBP.
   c. Print the City and Price for all the cities.
   d. Use the FlightData class to represent the flight data. e.g. Create attributes for price, departure_airport_code, departure_city etc.
   
4. If the returned price < 'Lowest Price' column, send an SMS.
   - Twilio
   a. Check if any of the flights found are cheaper than the Lowest Price listed in the Google Sheet.
   b. If so, use the Twilio API to send an SMS with enough information to book the flight. 
   c. Use the NotificationManager for this job.
   d. Message should Include:
      - Price
      - Departure City Name
      - Departure Airport IATA Code
      - Arrival City Name
      - Arrival Airport IATA Code
      - Outbound Date
      - Inbound Date
