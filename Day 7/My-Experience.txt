Day 7 was particularly hard to do because I had to prepare a presentation pack at work the next day, so I had to wake up very early. 
I was also experiencing some serious stomach upset from the previous day.
This made me almost suspend the lesson for the day.
I just pushed through the videos at might but I believe it was worth it.
