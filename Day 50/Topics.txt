Project: BUild an Automate Tinder Swiper

New Selenium Skills:
1. Finding elements by XPath is easier. 
   You can generate your own xpath string with this format: '//<tag_name>[@<attribute>="<value>"]'
   e.g. xpath = '//button[@title="Accept All"]'
        xpath = '//*[@name="__CONFIRM__"]'

2. Waiting for pages to load while searching for elements
      driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=chrome_driver_path)
      driver.implicitly_wait(10) 
      
      driver.find_element_by_id(id_="username")  # Webdriver will search for the element for 10 seconds before throwing the 'NoSuchElementException' if not found.
      
3. Get list of open window handles and switch between windows.
      open_windows = driver.window_handles
      base_window = open_windows[0]
      fb_login_window = open_windows[1]
      driver.switch_to.window(fb_login_window)
      print(driver.title)

Steps:

A. Account Setup:
   1. Set up and sign into your Tinder account.
   2. Manually swipe on profiles and see which elements you'll need to target with your code.
   
B. Navigate to the log in page
   3. Using Selenium and Python Navigate to the Tinder website (https://tinder.com/) and click on LOG IN then LOGIN WITH FACEBOOK. 
      - For a NoSuchElementException, make sure there's some delay between clicking on buttons so that the new element has enough time to load.
      - Right click on the element and get the XPath to use with Selenium.

C. Handle pop-up windows
   4. The Facebook login page opens in a new window. In order for our selenium code to work on the new window, we have to switch to the window in front.
      Use the code snippet in the Skills section to switch between windows.
        
   5. Fill in the Facebook login form and submit it to log in.
       - Avoid invoking the Facebook Login too frequently, see if you can test your code without logging in. 
       - You dont't want to be mistaken for a bot to Facebook as there is always the chance that they might disable your FB account.

   6. Revert back to the base_window and verify by printing the title of the Selenium controlled window title.
        driver.switch_to.window(base_window)
        print(driver.title)
    
D. Dismiss all pop-up requests
   7. When you first login to Tinder, it will ask if it's ok to get your location, send you notifications and track your cookies. 
      Dismiss all of these modal pop-ups.
      - Click ALLOW for location.
      - Click NOT INTERESTED for notifications.
      - Click I ACCEPT for cookies

E. Hit Like, Swipe Right!
   8. Like some people. 
      Because it's the web version, just click on the "Like" button. 
      Add at least a 1 second delay between "Likes" so that Tinder doesn't block you because you seem like a bot.

   - You'll get a ElementClickInterceptedException if a pop-up appears while you're clicking a button.
     Dismiss the pop-up by clicking on "BACK TO TINDER" to continue swiping.

   - You are limited to 100 swipes per day.
