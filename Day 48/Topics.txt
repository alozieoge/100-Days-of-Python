5. By xpath
6. By link text

- You can automate interaction with the website elements by clicking .click() and typing .send_keys()
- Selenium webdriver has a Keys class that has constants for each keyboard key.


Automated Cookie Clicker Project Steps:

1. Visit the game website and familiarise yourself with how it works:
   http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/

2. Create a bot using Selenium and Python to click on the cookie as fast as possible.

3. Every 5 seconds, check the right hand pane to see which upgrades are affordable and purchase the most expensive one. 
   You'll need to check how much money (cookies) you have against the price of each upgrade.
   
4. After 5 minutes have passed since starting the game, stop the bot and print the "cookies/second".

5. Tweak the algorithm if you think there is a better way to play the game. 
   e.g. Change the time, instead of every 5 seconds to check the upgrades, what if you did every second. 
   Or maybe the bot should buy all the affordable upgrades.
