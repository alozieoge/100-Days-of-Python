Topic: Data Exploration with Pandas

Project: Analyse post-university graduate salaries by major.

Objective: Dig into the data to answer:
1. Which degrees have the highest starting salaries? 
2. Which majors have the lowest earnings after college?
3. Which degrees have the highest earning potential?
4. What are the lowest risk college majors from an earnings standpoint?
5. Do business, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) or HASS (Humanities, Arts, Social Science) degrees earn more on average?

Lessons:
1. How to explore a Pandas DataFrame
2. How to detect NaN (not a number) values and clean your data
3. How to select particular columns, rows, and individual cells
4. How to sort your data
5. How to group data by category

Steps:
0. Setup your Google Colab
1. Upload the Data and Read the .csv File.
2. Preliminary Data Exploration and Data Cleaning with Pandas
   a. Rows and Columns
   b. Missing Data
   c. Drop Rows with NaN
3. Accessing Columns and Individual Cells in a Dataframe
   a. Using [], .loc[], .max(), .min(), .idxmax(), .idxmin()
   b. Nested slicing
4. Sorting Values & Adding Columns Majors with the Most Potential vs Lowest Risk
   a. .subtract(), .insert()
   b. .sort_values()
