Topic: Computation with NumPy and N-Dimensional Arrays

Project:

Notebook: Google Drive / Day 76 / Computation_with_Numpy_and_N_Dimensional_Arrays_(start).ipynb

Lessons:
1. Leverage the power of NumPy's ndarrays.
2. Access individual values and subsets inside an n-dimensional array.
3. Broadcasting with ndarrays.
4. Linear algebra with NumPy.
5. Generate points that you can plot on a chart.
6. Manipulate images as ndarrays.

Steps:
0. Upload and setup the starting notebook.

1. NumPy's ndarray
   a. 1d-array
   b. 2d-array
   c. n-dimensional array / tensor
   
2. NumPy Array Manipulations
   a. To reverse an array:
        np.flip(array) or array[::-1]
   b. To get the indicies all non-zero elements:
        np.nonzero(array)
   c. To generate a 3-d array of random numbers
        np.random.rand(288, 288, 3) or np.random.random((288, 288, 3))

3. Linear Algebra with Vectors
   a. Broadcasting: 
      When performing algebraic calculations between 2 or more arrays, NumPy will first make the shape of the smaller array or scalar to be the compatible with the larger array.
   b. To do matrix multiplication or vector product:
        np.matmul(a1, b1)
        # or
        a1 @ b1
      Condition: a1.shape[1] = b1.shape[0]

4. Manipulating Images as ndarrays
   a.
