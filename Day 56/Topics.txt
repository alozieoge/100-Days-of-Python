Project: Build a live personal business card website.

Flask Rendering Templates Requirements:
1. HTML code files should be stored in a folder named 'templates' in the project directory.
2. Static files e.g. CSS, images, videos ... should be stored in a folder named 'static' in the project directory.

- To edit a website in Google Chrome:
  Go to: Ctrl + Shift + C (Developer Tools) --> Console --> Type: 
         document.body.ContentEditable=true
         
Project Steps:
1. Download the website template at: https://html5up.net/uploads/demos/identity/
2. Create a new PyCharm project called name-card and create a new Flask Application from scratch.
3. Create the necessary folders and move the relevant files from the download in step1.
4. Get the website to work when you access the root route ("/")
5. Personalise the website, change the background image, change the text, change the links, make it your own.
   - Replace the background image by over-writing the existing file.
   - Changing the href attribute in the footer list items automatically changes the icons used.
