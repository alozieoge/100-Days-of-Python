Project: Build an Amazon Price Tracking Bot

Skills: 
- Making HTTP GET requests with requests
- Web scraping with BeautifulSoup
- Python string manipulation
- Sending email with smtplib

Steps:
1. Find a product on Amazon that you want to track and get the product URL.

2. Use the requests library to request the HTML page of the Amazon product using the URL above.

3. Use BeautifulSoup to make soup with the web page HTML you get back. Use the "lxml" parser instead of the "html.parser".

4. Use BeautifulSoup to get hold of the price of the item as a floating point number and print it. 
   Use "".join() and split() methods to extract the number from the text result.
   
5. When the price is below your chosen threshold price, use the smtp module to send an email to yourself. 
   In the email, include the title of the product, the current price and a link to buy the product.
