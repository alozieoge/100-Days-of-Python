Project: Build a website for our top-10 movies of all time using Flask + WTForms + Bootstrap + SQLite + SQLAlchemy.

Lessons: 
1. In Flask, only if you put a parameter in your decorator url like @app.route('/books/<somevariable>'), 
   should you pass some variable to the endpoint function as an argument and write: def myfunction(somevariable):

2. 

Requirements / Steps:
0. Download the starting files and install all required packages.

1. View movie list items.
   a. Create an SQLite database with SQLAlchemy. ✅
      The database needs to contain a "Movie" Table. 
      This table should contain the following fields:
      - id 
      - title 
      - year 
      - description 
      - rating 
      - ranking
      - review
      - img_url
     
   b. Using code/DB Viewer, add a new entry to the database. ✅
      Remove the add entry code from above after running the code once. 
      Otherwise, you'll get the: sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError ...
      
   c. Make the code work so that each entry in the database is displayed correctly on the front and back of the card on the home page. ✅
   
2. Edit a movie's rating and reviews. ✅
   a. Use WTForms to create the RateMovieForm. 
      Use this to create a Quick Form to be rendered in edit.html.
      
   b. Once the form is submitted and validated, add the updates to the corresponding movie entry in the database. ✅
   
3. Delete movies from the database.
