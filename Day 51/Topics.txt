Project: Build a Automated Complaining Twitter Bot
Objective: Bot tweets @ the Internet Service Provider (ISP) when the download/upload speed is below a threshold.

Skills:
1. Find HTML elements using Xpath and CSS selectors.
2. Implicit wait for loading websites.
3. OOP class.

Steps:
1. Setup Twitter account
   a. Sign up on Twitter
   b. Get your Internet Service Provider (ISP)'s guaranteed internet speeds from your contract.
   c. Add these details as constants in the main code file.
   
2. Use OOP - create a class.
   a. Create a class - InternetSpeedBot.
   b. In the __init__() method, create the Selenium driver and 2 other properties down and up.
   c. Create two methods - get_internet_speed() and tweet_at_provider().
   d. In the main.py, initialise the object and call the two methods in order. 
      Where you first get the internet speed and then tweet at the provider.
      
3. Get internet speeds
   a. Get your current live download and upload speeds from https://speedtest.net manually.
   b. Get your internet speeds using Selenium and Python and print it out to console. 

4. Build a Twitter bot
   a. Go through the process of logging-in and tweeting on Twitter to study which selectors/id/classes/XPATHs you could target.
   b. Use Python and Selenium to complete the same process - 
      - Login to Twitter, 
      - Compose the tweet to include your up/down speeds and your promised speeds, 
      - Send the tweet.
