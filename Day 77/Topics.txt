Topic: Linear Regression and Data Visualization with Seaborn

Notebook: 

Lessons:
1. Use a popular data visualisation library called Seaborn 
2. Run and interpret a linear regression with scikit-learn
3. Plot a regression a scatter plot to visualise relationships in the data
4. Add a third dimension to a scatter plot to create a bubble chart
5. Use floor division // to convert your data

Tools:
1. Seaborn
2. Scikit-Learn

Steps:
0. Upload and setup the starting notebook. 

1. Explore and clean the movie budget data.
   a. Get descriptive stats
   b. Replace currency symbols
   c. Convert strings to numbers
   d. Movies with zero revenue

2. Filter on Multiple Conditions
   a. To apply multiple conditions to a dataFrame, use the bitwise operators |, &, ~. 
      Pandas supports bitwise operations since it is built on NumPy.
        df.loc[(df[col1]!= 0) & (df[col2]=0)]
   b. Also use the df.query() method
        df.query(expr='col1 != 0 and col2 == 0')

3. Visualizing Data with Seaborn
   a. Importing seaborn
        import seaborn as sns
   b. Seaborn is built on Matplotlib so reuses some of the functionality.
      But it also supports plotting from dataFrames.
        sns.scatter(data=df, x='x-col', y='y-col')
        sns.plot()
