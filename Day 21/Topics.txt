Build a Pong game

Beakdown the Problem:

1. Create the screen
   - Black screen.
   - 800 x 600

2. Create and move a paddle
   - Paddle is a Turtle object (class inheritance).
   - Width = 20
   - Height = 100
   - X position = 350
   - Y position = 0
   - Can move only up and down.
   - 20 pixel pace.

3. Create another paddle
   - Move second paddle with 'w' and 's' keys.

4. Create the ball and make it move
   - Width = Height = 20
   - X position = Y position = 0
   - Ball is a turtle graphics object.
   - Control screen animation to view the ball's motion.

5. Detect collision with wall and bounce
   - Ball bounces after collision with top and bottom walls only.
   - Bouncing means change in the sign of y_step (dy).

6. Detect collision with paddle
   - Ball bounces after collision with paddles.
   - Bouncing means change in the sign of x_step (dx).
   
7. Detect when paddle misses ball
   - When ball crosses the wall boundary.
   - Reset ball position to centre of screen.
   - Ball starts moving in the opposite x-direction.

8. Keep score
