3. Create / make a copy of the Google Sheet containing the workout data table.

4. Setup your Google Sheet url with Sheety. Setup Sheety Authentication configuration.

5. Use the Sheety API to POST a new row of workout data to the Workout Google sheet based on the exercise text input and response from Nutrtionix API request. 
   - https://sheety.co/docs/requests.html
   - When POSTing to headers with spaces in the name, write the key in camelCase
     e.g. Google Sheet header = "First Name" --> Sheety JSON key = "firstName".

6. Define the API keys, API ID and authentication header items as environment variables.
