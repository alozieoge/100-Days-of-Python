Topic: Analysing the Nobel Prize with PLotly, Matplotlib and Seaborn

Project: Analyse dataset on past Nobel Prize winners.

Notebook: Google Drive / Day 78 / 

Lessons:
1. Create a Choropleth to display data on a map.
2. Create bar charts showing different segments of the data with plotly.
3. Create Sunburst charts with plotly.
4. Use Seaborn's .lmplot() and show best-fit lines across multiple categories using the row, hue, and lowess parameters.
5. Understand how a different picture emerges when looking at the same data in different ways (e.g., box plots vs a time series analysis).
6. See the distribution of our data and visualise descriptive statistics with the help of a histogram in Seaborn.

Steps:
0. Upload and setup the starting notebook.

1. Update Packages in Google Colab & Explore and Clean the Dataset. 
   a. To upgrade a package:
        %pip install --upgrade plotly
