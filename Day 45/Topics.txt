How to get instances of HTML elements with BeautifulSoup

  soup = BeautifulSoup(markup="", parser="", features="")

  Parser = "html.parser" or "lxml"

1. Using the object property. Returns only the 1st instance of the element that matched.
   soup.title
   soup.a
   soup.li
   
2. Using the find() and find_all() methods.
   a. To get the 1st matching instance of an element tag 
      soup.find(name="h1")
      
   b. To get the 1st matching instance of an element tag with the specified id.
      soup.find(name="h1", id="name")
  
   c. To get all matching instances of an HTML tag with the specified class name
      soup.find_all(name="h1", class_="heading")

3. Using the select_one() and select() methods to drill into nested tags.
   a. To get the 1st matching instance of a nested element tag 
      soup.select_one(select="p a")
      
   b. To get the 1st matching instance of an element tag with the specified id.
      soup.select_one(selector="#name")
  
   c. To get all matching instances of an HTML tag with the specified class name
      soup.select(selector=".heading")
