Steps:
0. Download the starting project files + database and install required packages. âœ…ðŸ”°

1. Register new users
   a. Install missing packages - flask_wtf, email_validator. âœ…
   b. Allow users to go to the /register route to sign up to your blog website. âœ…
      Create a WTForm in forms.py called RegisterForm and use Flask-Bootstrap to render a wtf quick_form.
   c. Use the generate_password_hash() to hash and salt the provided user password before writing it to the database. âœ…
   d. Redirect to the Home page after sign up. âœ…

2. Login registered users
   a. Users who have been successfully registered (added to the user table in the database) should be able to go to the /login route to use their credentials to log in. âœ…
   b. Add 1 line of code in the /register route so that when users successfully register they are taken back to the home page and are logged in with Flask-Login. âœ…
   c. In the in the /register route, if a user is trying to register with an email that already exists in the database, they should be redirected to the /login route. âœ…
      A flash message will tell them to log in with that email instead.
   d. In the /login route, if a user's email does not exist in the database or if their password does not match the one stored using check_password(), they should be redirected back to /login and a flash message to let them know what the issue was and ask them to try again. âœ…
   d. Implement the load_user() callback function for the login_manager.user_loader decorator. âœ…
   e. Login the user if successful with flask_login login_user(). âœ…
   e. Update the navbar so that when a user is logged, it does not show the 'Register' and 'Login' menu options. âœ…
   f. Code up the /logout route so that when the user clicks on the LOG OUT button, it logs them out and takes them back to the home page. âœ…
