Project: Website-based higher-lower game.
Aim: Use Flask to host a web-server where the user can play the Guess-a-Number game.

Steps:
1. Create a new project in PyCharm called higher-lower, add a server.py file.
2. Create a new Flask application where the home route displays an <h1> that says "Guess a number between 0 and 9" and display a gif of your choice from giphy.com.
3. Generate a random number between 0 and 9 or any range of numbers of your choice.
4. Create a route that can detect the number entered by the user e.g "URL/3" or "URL/9" and checks that number against the generated random number. 
   If the number is too low, tell the user it's too low, same with too high or if they found the correct number. 
   Make the <h1> text a different colour for each page.
