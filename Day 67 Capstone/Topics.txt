Topic: Blog Capstone 3 - RESTful Routing

Project: Update my blog by adding HTTP routes to:
- create new blog posts
- edit posts
- delete posts

Tips:
1. When you make changes in the Jinja2 Templating of an HTML file, stop and re-run the server to see the changes.

Lessons:
1. The data from the CKEditorField is saved as HTML and contains all the structure and styling of the blog post. 
   In order for this structure to be reflected when you go to the post.html page for the blog post, you need to add a Jinja safe() filter.
   This makes sure that when Jinja renders the post.html template, it doesn't treat the HTML as text. 
   To apply a Jinja filter, you need the pipe symbol "|" and this goes between the Jinja expression and Jinja filter. 
   e.g. {{ Jinja expression | Jinja filter }}
   
2. HTML forms (WTForms included) do not accept PUT, PATCH or DELETE methods. 
   So while modifying/updating a databse entry would normally be a PUT request (replacing existing data), because the request is coming from a HTML form, you should instead accept the edited post as a POST request.

Steps:
0. Download the starting project files and install required packages.

1. GET a new Blog Post. 
   a. Read the blog posts from the posts.db database and display them on the Home page. ✅
   b. Read the selected blog post from the database and display it when selected. ✅

2. POST a new Blog Post. 
   a. Create a new POST route called /new-post in your Flask server to render the make-post.html page when you click on the "Create New Post" button. ✅
   b. Use the Flask CKEditor package to make the Blog Content (body) input in the WTForm into a full CKEditor. ✅
   c. Make the 'Submit Post' button to be blue instead of white. ✅
      Add a 'button_map' parameter to the wtf quickform and make the 'submit' field a Bootstrap "primary" button.
        {{ wtf.quick_form(form, novalidate=true, button_map={'submit': 'primary'}) }}
   d. When the user is done typing out entries to all the fields, the data in the form should be saved as a BlogPost Object into the posts.db  ✅
      Once the post is saved, redirect the user to the home page and the new post should show up if the saving process was successful.
   e. The date be automatically calculated using the datetime module in the server. ✅
      The date needs to be formatted like this: <Month> <Day>, <Year> e.g. August 31, 2019
   f. In the 'post.html', apply the Jinja filter (safe) to render the HTML styling tags and not treat the HTML as text. ✅
   
3. Edit Existing Blog Posts
   a. Create a new route /edit-post/<post_id> ✅
      If the user came from "Create New Post" the <h1> should read "New Post", but if the user came to edit a particular blog post, it should read "Edit Post".
   b. When you go to make-post.html it should auto-populate the fields in the WTForm with the blog post's data.  ✅
      The user doesn't have to type out their blog post again. 
      Do this by passing the post Object's properties when you create the form. ✅
   c. When the user is done editing in the WTForm, they click "Submit Post", the post should now be updated in the database.  ✅
      Redirect the user to the post.html page for that blog post.
   d. HTML and WTForms do not accept PUT, PATCH or DELETE methods.  ✅
      When the intention is to modify/update the database entry, because the request is coming from a HTML form, you should accept the edited post as a POST request.
   e. The date field should not be changed, it should represent the original date the post was made. Not the date of the edit. ✅

4. Delete Existing Blog Posts
   a. In index.html create an anchor tag that just shows a ✘ character next to each post. ✅
   b. Clicking it should delete the post from the database and redirect the user to the home page. ✅
      You need to create a DELETE route at the path /delete/<post_id>
