Project: Build an Instagram Follower Bot.

Objective: An automated script that follows all the followers of your favorite / target Instagram account.

New Skills:
1. Scroll down in a pop-up window using CSS.

     popup_window = driver.find_element_by_xpath(xpath=xpath)
     scrolls = n
     for i in range(scrolls):
        popup_window.send_keys(Keys.END)
        sleep(1)

2. Scroll dowen in a modal window by executing javascript:

     modal = self.driver.find_element_by_xpath('/html/body/div[4]/div/div/div[2]')
     for i in range(10):
         # In this case we're executing some Javascript, that's what the execute_script() method does. 
         # The method can accept the script as well as a HTML element. 
         # The modal in this case, becomes the arguments[0] in the script.
         # Then we're using Javascript to say: "scroll to the top of the modal (popup) element by the height of the modal (popup)"
         self.driver.execute_script("arguments[0].scrollTop = arguments[0].scrollHeight", modal)
         time.sleep(2)


Steps:
1. Get your credentials
   a. Setup your Instagram account: https://www.instagram.com/
   b. Find an account you would like to target. (Pick a large account that has a lot of followers)
   
2. Create a class
   a. Create a class called InstaFollower.
   b. In the init() method, create the Selenium driver.
   c. Create three methods - login() and find_followers() and follow().
   d. From main.py, initialise the object and call the 3 methods in order.
   
3. Login to Instagram
   a. Use Selenium and Python to login to Instagram automatically using your email and password. 
      Write your code in the login() method.
      
4. Find target account
   a. When you go to a target Instagram account, you can click on their follower count to see all their followers. 
      The URL is the name of the Instagram account added to the end of 'instagram.com'
   b. Scroll down on the followers popup with 1 second delay. 
      Write your code in the find_followers() method.
   c. You might encounter an account that you have already followed, in this case, when you press on the button it will generate a popup asking if you want to unfollow that person.
      When this happens the follow button is hidden under the popup and you will get a ElementClickInterceptedException  if you try to continue clicking on the follow button. 
      Handle this exception and when it occurs, simply click on the "Cancel" button to dismiss the popup and continue to follow other people.
