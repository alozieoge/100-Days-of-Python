Capstone Project: Data Entry Job Automation

Objective: Automate a data entry job that: 
- Extracts house rent prices and details from Zillow,
- Enters the results in a Google Form and submits the entry,
- Creates a spreadsheet of entries in a Google Sheet.

Requirements:
1. Create your own form at https://docs.google.com/forms/.

2. Add 3 questions to the form, make all questions "short-answer"
   a. What's the address of the property?
   b. What's the price per month?
   c. What's the link to the property?

3. Click send and copy the link address of the form. You will need to use this in your program.

4. Go to this web address on Zillow and see how the website where you'll be scraping the data is structured.

Main Program:
5. Use BeautifulSoup/Requests to scrape all the listings from the Zillow web address (Step 4 above).
   a. Create a list of links for all the listings you scraped.
   b. Create a list of prices for all the listings you scraped.
   c. Create a list of addresses for all the listings you scraped.
   
6. Use Selenium to fill in the form you created (step 1,2,3 above). 
   Each listing should have its price/address/link added to the form. 
   Fill in a new form for each new listing.
   
7. Once all the data has been filled in, click on the "Sheet" icon to create a Google Sheet from the responses to the Google Form. 
   You should end up with a spreadsheet with all the details from the properties.
